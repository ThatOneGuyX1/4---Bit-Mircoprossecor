# 4--Bit-Mircoprossecor
As part of my ECEN 250 class at BYU- Idaho, I built and designed each compoent of a simple mircoprosceser. The only parts I did not design were the ROMS and ASCII table. 
I designed muxes, counters, and ALU. I wrote the machine code for it and programmed it to do a few simple function. This is a great showcase of a basic digital system.
